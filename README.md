# Wolcen Save Manager
This is a simple program that will watch your: Wolcen character files, player chest, player data and back them up every minute. For now the program won't automatically detect if your save has been corrupted and replace it for you, you'll have to do that part yourself. All backups follow the same folder hierarchy as the Wolcen files and can be found inside `%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/wolcen-backup`.
